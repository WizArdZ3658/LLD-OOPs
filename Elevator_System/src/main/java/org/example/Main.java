We are talking about a smart elevator system found is large office buildings. This is actually a difficult question.
Its core features are:

track state of lifts i.e. floor lift is at, move direction, number of passengers, existing and future requests.
assign lift optimally to a user who is on a given floor and wants to go to a destination floor.
A lift in an elevator system can be in one of three states.
Moving Up, Moving Down and Idle
And in each state it will behave differently in taking decisions like
whether to stop on a floor, add a new request or not etc.
We will use state design pattern to solve this problem.
