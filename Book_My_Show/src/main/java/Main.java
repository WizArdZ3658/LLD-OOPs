Problem statement and Machine coding practice link: https://codezym.com/question/10

In this question, core functionalities will include:

adding new cinema halls and new shows in those cinema halls.
Users can also book and cancel tickets.
Users should also be able to list all cinemas in a city which are displaying a particular movie.
Also they should be able to fetch list of all shows in a cinema hall which are displaying a particular movie.
Classes implementing last two search features need to updated whenever a new show gets added, so that they can update their respective lists.

We use observer design pattern to send new show added updates to the search movie/show classes.
