Problem statement and Machine coding practice link: https://codezym.com/question/4

This question has been asked in machine coding round of companies like Meesho. Inventory is number of items of a
particular product in seller’s warehouse.

Core functionalities of an inventory management system include:

adding inventory and creating new orders
fetching inventory available for a particular product from a seller
fetching list of sellers who have enough inventory to fulfill a given order.
This question doesn’t require any design pattern to solve it. However it is tested in a multi-threaded environment.
So using thread safe data structures/locks/synchronization is important here.
